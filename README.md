# Everything_Cyberpunk_2077_v2

Everything Cyberpunk is a newsletter based on the up and coming popular RPG currently in development by the gaming company CD Projekt Red.
This is the second version created for this project, in this version i have completely re-created all elements and i have been able to clean up the previous HTML and CSS and have a much cleaner layout.

The previous versions repository can be found here "https://github.com/ShrewdStyle/Everything-Cyberpunk-2077"

This newsletter will have all need to know information on the current state of the game and additional information e.g. the lore, characters played etc...

This project was also a good opportinuty for me to implement a online store where users are able to select certain products and then have a subtotal, total and the VAT total included.
