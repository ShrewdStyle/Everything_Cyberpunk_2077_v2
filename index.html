                  Cyberpunk 2077's map "might be a little bit smaller" than
                  Witcher 3, but it's way more dense. The abiliy to traverse the
                  map vertical in the huge skyscraper buildings is something
                  truly unique which CD Projekt Red have added in.

                  Cyberpunk is set in a dystopian near-future, amid a fictional
                  Californian city named Night City after its founder, Richard
                  Night. Between then and now, the USA has suffered a vast
                  socioeconomic collapse that has sent ripples around the world,
                  throwing the entire planet – especially the West – into chaos.

                  "I've got a couple people who I've worked with who've done
                  voices in games," Reeves said. "I hadn't done that yet. For me
                  I was attracted to the storytelling. The different versions.
                  It's not just choose-your-own end but choose-your-own path in
                  a weird way, which I thought was cool." - Keanu Reeves

                  Nowakowski says "Currently we are working on Cyberpunk and the
                  multiplayer as the next big game, the triple-A release we are
                  working on is Cyberpunk multiplayer. We are trying to be as
                  clear as possible in this regard. The date we're releasing
                  Cyberpunk multiplayer - I mean, that's a code name for it will
                  probably move out of 2021."

                    'We are currently at a stage where the game is complete and
                    playable, but there's still work to be done. Night City is
                    massive - full of stories, content and places to visit, but
                    due to the sheer scale and complexity of it all, we need
                    more time to finish playtesting, fixing and polishing. We
                    want Cyberpunk 2077 to be our crowning achievement for this
                    generation and postponing launch will give us the precious
                    months we need to make the game perfect' - Marcin Iwinski &
